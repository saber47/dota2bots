Library of Dota 2 Bot scripts

## Intention
This repo exists to give people a shared codebase for their custom bot scripts. Fork this repo to develop some scripts yourself or push your new scripts or changes to existing scripts against it to share your work.
Together we can create a shared Bot AI for all the heroes out there in Dota. Have fun! :)

## Form
For utility functions, please keep one function per file and name the file after the function so we can keep the directories clean, understandable and usable for everyone.
